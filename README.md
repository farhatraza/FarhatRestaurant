Application Description:

I built a Chat bot to place orders for your favourite foods. Shawrama, Fries, and Emapada were the three things on the menu that I prepared. Size and another feature, such as toppings, are included in the menu items. I also up-sell items, such as drinks in this case. It displays the entire price together with the order name at the bottom.
